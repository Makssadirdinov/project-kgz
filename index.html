                    <p class="popup__text"> Kyrgyzstan is dominated by the Tian Shan, a large mountain range that divides the country into northern and southern parts. The most densely populated parts of the country are the wide valleys around the mountains, like the Chuy Valley in the north and the Fergana Valley in the south. These areas are home to the largest cities in Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek and Osh, and to most of the farms and agriculture. Even in the city, one is never far from some beautiful viewpoint, be that a mountain, nature preserve, lake, or just a charming road through the country.</p>
                    <p class="popup__text">Sometimes referred to as the pearl of Central Asia, Lake Issyk-Kul is the world’s second-largest alpine lake. The north shore is where the largest number of resorts and public beaches are located, while the south shore is famous for its nature and gorges. Karakol, the largest city in Issyk-Kul Province, is the starting point for many treks to some of the most famous glaciers and surrounding mountains. From Karakol, one can visit Jeti Oguz and other striking red sandstone formations. </p>
                    <p class="popup__text"> The Tian Shan themselves are a whole ecosystem: deep gorges with rushing rivers, rocky peaks, small forests, and broad high-altitude pastures. In the summer, these high pastures are dotted with the yurts of semi-nomadic herdsmen, who bring their animals to feed on the rich grasses. Hidden between many of the peaks are lakes, some of which are seasonal, depending on glacial melt. Son Kul is one of the most famous mountain lakes and is a favorite place for many in the nature of Kyrgyzstan, is located roughly 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) above sea level and is only accessible in the summer. Pobeda Peak, located on the border with China, is the highest peak of the Tian Shan, reaching 7,439 meters (24,406 feet) above sea level. Nearby is Khan Tengri, with a peak at just around 7,000 meters (23,000 feet), depending on whether or not you count the glacial cap</p>

                    Kyrgyzstan culture is heavily influenced by the traditions from nomadic life. Kyrgyz culture features influences from Russia, Persia, and Turkey, but yet remains something entirely unique. Nature influences are prominent, from the designs to the music, and many traditions reflect the fact that nomads lived closely with nature. Perhaps the most well known aspect of Kyrgyz culture is the Epic of Manas, an incredibly long poem passed down orally for generations.

                        <p class="popup__text">As nomads, the Kyrgyz people always lived closely with nature. From their housing to their clothing, everything was designed to adapt to changing weather and locations. Yurts are easy to take apart and carry, and can be made warmer for winter, and cooler for summer. The textiles inside of yurts, such as shyrdaks and tush kyiz (felt rugs and embroidered hangings), take their inspiration from designs found in nature, such as plants, animals, and landscapes. Even clothing was made out of natural materials, and designed to be comfortable while still stylish. </p>
                        <p class="popup__text">Horses were, and still are, central to Kyrgyzstan culture. They provided not only transportation, but played crucial roles in wars and even cuisine. Kumis, or kymyz, is made from mare’s milk, and some traditional dishes feature horse meat. Horses traditionally played roles in courtship and marriage ceremonies, and could be used as payment or as dowries. Some instruments were even designed so that they could be played on horseback, and the beat of hooves can be heard in traditional Kyrgyz music. </p>
                        <p class="popup__text">It’s no surprise then that horsemanship is valued in Kyrgyz culture. Sports are ways to develop both riders and horses, and to make both better prepared for hunting and battle. Competitions testing dogs and birds of prey on their speed and accuracy found the best hunters, who would be essential in the winter. </p>
                        <p class="popup__text">Many of these elements can still be found today, though Kyrgyzstan is also still a modern country. People are proud of the culture in Kyrgyzstan, and events are held to make sure that it is kept alive and promoted. Visitors can expect to be immersed in these nomadic and traditional elements, especially if they stay with a host family. </p>

                    The Kyrgyz are a nomadic people, representatives of the ancient culture of nomads. Not only the worldview, philosophy and attitude to life, but also the culture of food have been formed for centuries as a result of the nomadic lifestyle. Their diet consisted of meat and dairy products. Since ancient times, nomads have grown millet and barley. These products were also included in the diet of the Kyrgyz.

                        <p class="popup__text">  The national cuisine in Kyrgyzstan is rich and varied. It has been formed throughout the history of the Kyrgyz people and has absorbed the most delicious dishes and drinks left over from the time of nomadic life, as well as dishes of neighboring peoples in the region.
                            Since the nomadic lifestyle requires a lot of strength and energy, the national dishes of the Kyrgyz are distinguished by their extraordinary nutritional value and calorie content. Their main ingredients are meat, milk, flour and cereals.</p>
                        <p class="popup__text">  The most famous Kyrgyz dish is beshbarmak - boiled, finely chopped lamb, filled with broth, with the addition of onions and noodles. The name of this dish is translated from Kyrgyz as "five fingers", and is traditionally eaten with the hands.First, guests are given zhash shorpo - a strong broth seasoned with onions, then kuiruk-boor - liver and fat tail fat, cut into small slices and seasoned with a special sauce, then kabyrga - ribs with a thick layer of meat and lard. Finally, beshbarmak itself is served on a large dish - finely chopped meat mixed with noodles and seasoned with onion sauce. </p>
                        <p class="popup__text">A variety of soup - shorpo - is also very popular. This is a hot broth with pieces of meat, potatoes, carrots and herbs. Fried meat among the Kyrgyz is called kuurdak: meat (lamb, beef, horse meat) is cut into large pieces and fried together with onions in fat tail fat. Horse meat sausage - chuchuk, as well as liver and blood sausage with spices - byzhy are considered a delicacy.</p>
                        <p class="popup__text">No meal is complete without bread. Usually, bread is in the form of flatbreads, which are cooked in cauldrons (geomkyormyo tokoch), in a frying pan (geomechtön) or in special ovens (tandoor-nan). On holidays, they prepare a special treat - boorsok - sweet pieces of yeast dough fried in oil.
                            Dairy products are also an invariable part of the Kyrgyz meal. We especially love ayran - a very thick fermented milk drink made from sheep's milk.</p>
